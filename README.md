# This is a weather checking site and due to it not having a backend. I had to store a very large txt file o all cities in it. Which made the loading times very slow. 
## The link : https://weather-changed.netlify.app/

### The loadings can be inconsistent sometimes due to using multiple API's. Please reload if you see a blank page right after you see the website.
